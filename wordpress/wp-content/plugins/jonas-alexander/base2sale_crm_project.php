                        <p>
                            I was tasked with modernizing an old Laravel program, upgrading it from PHP 5 to PHP 8 and expanding it with new features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            New features included a calendar for key account managers to manage appointments, a dashboard overview with key sales metrics, and a detailed customer view. The customer view provided info, purchase history, and an advanced subview combining a floorplan builder and webshop, supporting complex drag-and-drop for both equipment and products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also decoupled the frontend from Laravelâ€™s Blade templates, building a new reactive frontend in Next.js for a more modern user experience.

                            The modernization of the Base2Sale CRM system involved a comprehensive upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 8, significantly enhancing performance, security, and compatibility with modern web technologies. This upgrade was crucial for leveraging the latest features of the Laravel framework, ensuring the system could handle increased loads and provide a more robust backend infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A key aspect of the modernization was decoupling the frontend from Laravel's Blade templates. I rebuilt the frontend using Next.js, a React-based framework, to create a more dynamic and responsive user interface. This transition allowed for improved user experiences through faster page loads and more interactive elements, utilizing React.js and Redux for efficient state management.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The backend was restructured using Laravel, taking advantage of its powerful features like Eloquent ORM for database interactions, which streamlined data handling and improved system performance. The use of Laravel migrations facilitated seamless database updates and schema management, ensuring consistency across different environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the database, MySQL hosted on One.com was used, providing a reliable and scalable solution to support the CRM's data-intensive operations. This setup ensured that the system could efficiently manage large volumes of data and user interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            New features were integrated into the CRM, including a more organized and easy to use calendar system for key account managers to manage appointments efficiently. A detailed dashboard was developed to provide an overview of key sales metrics, such as total sales, confirmed orders, sales growth, returning customers, abandoned purchases, top 10 customers, sales by category/city/customer type, monthly sales, and customer insights, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning. Additionally, a detailed customer view was implemented, offering information, purchase history, and an advanced subview combining a floorplan builder and webshop with complex drag-and-drop functionalities for both equipment and products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            DevOps practices were integral to the project, with Jest and PHPUnit used for thorough testing to ensure code quality and system reliability. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines were managed through GitHub Actions, facilitating automated testing and deployment processes. The application was hosted on Google Cloud, ensuring high availability and performance.
